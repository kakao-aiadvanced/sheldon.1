Sunlight enters our atmosphere and consists of a broad spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the visible light.\\n2. When this light encounters the small molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), it scatters in all directions. However, shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths due to their smaller size.\\n\\nThis is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh, who first described this phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n\\n3. As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, making it visible from our vantage point on Earth.\\n4. When we look up at the sky, our eyes see the scattered blue light and perceive it as a blue color.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear more red or orange because the sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach us, scattering away even more of the shorter wavelengths (like blue) and allowing the longer wavelengths (like red) to dominate our view.\\n\\nI hope this explanation helps you understand why the sky is blue!\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))\n"
